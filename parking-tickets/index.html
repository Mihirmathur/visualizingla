				<p class="info">
					Who likes parking tickets??? We all see the parking patrol giving
					tickets and wince at just the thought of them coming up to your car.
					Parking tickets are one of the worst things about living in Los Angeles.
					That feeling of getting a ticket can never be matched.

				</p>
				<p class="info">
					With that said we decided to visualize how parking tickets are
					distributed throughout the city.  We have analyzed almost 3000 tickets
					from the past 3 years and projected them onto a map of Los Angeles.
					Our best tip if you want to avoid a ticket, stay away from downtown
					Los Angeles or any of the many touristy spots around Los Angeles.
				</p>
				<p class="info">
					The map data gets more and more precise the more that you zoom in,
					down to the very steet and cost of the fine.  To get more ticket info
					just click or mouse over the hexagons.
				</p>
				<p class="sub">
					Technologies used: Leaflet, Mapbox, D3, JQuery
